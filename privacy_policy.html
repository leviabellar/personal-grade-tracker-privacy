            <li>Capture images of assignments, tests, or other academic materials</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Local Data Storage</h3>

            <li>App preferences and settings</li>
            <li>User authentication data (if using cloud sync)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>All information collected is used solely for the following purposes:</p>

            <li>Syncing data across your devices (if cloud sync is enabled)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All your grade data and images are primarily stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to external servers unless you explicitly enable cloud synchronization.</p>

        <p><strong>Cloud Storage (Optional):</strong> If you choose to enable cloud sync features, your data may be stored securely using Firebase services, which are governed by Google's privacy policies.</p>

        <p><strong>Security:</strong> We implement appropriate security measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
